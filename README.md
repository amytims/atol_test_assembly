# atol_test_assembly

Test an assembly using the sanger-tol pipeline. Basically download the reads,
reformat them to suit the pipeline, and generate the YAML file.

## To do:

1. Check the hashes of the downloaded files
2. The [date is
   used](https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomeassembly/blob/115b8333bba5af6a55feea711a561118c3d511d5/conf/modules.config#L13)
   in the output folder names. This causes Nextflow to re-run tasks. It's also
   not reproducible. Find out why this was done.
   - *e.g.* every time you run the pipeline, the
     `nf-SANGERTOL_GENOMEASSEMBLY_GENOMEASSEMBLY_GENOMESCOPE_MODEL_CAT_CAT_READS`
     job and subsequent steps get launched.

## Findings so far

We download the reads from BPA, process them, and generate a config file on
Pawsey using a Snakemake workflow. We chose Snakemake because the BPA API uses
ckan, which has bindings in python.

The workflow then automatically uploads the processed reads and config file to
the S3 bucket on Acacia specified in `config.yaml`. A system for naming and
creating the S3 buckets will be needed, along the lines of
`{pawsey_project}.atol.{unique_identifier}`.

The DToL workflow can retrieve the read files from Acacia and publish its
results to Acacia. Right now the config file needs to be local because the DToL
workflow fails if the config file is stored on S3 (seems to be caused by some
paths being modified).

See https://github.com/TomHarrop/atol-test-profiles for examples of how the
workflow managers are configured to use Acacia.

## Notes

- We can register Acacia using the Snakemake [S3
  plugin](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/storage/s3.html).
  This will be useful for the process that downloads the read files.
- We should be able to load the files directly from Acacia into the DToL
  workflow by configuring [S3 in
  Nexflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/amazons3.html#s3-compatible-storage).
